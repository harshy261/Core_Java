1. Class Declaration: public class First declares a public class named First. In Java, every application must have at least one class definition that contains the main method.

2. Main Method: public static void main(String[] args) is the entry point of any Java application. When you run the program, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) looks for the main method to start execution.

3. public: The method is accessible from anywhere.

4. static: The method belongs to the class, not instances of the class.

5. void: The method does not return any value.

6. String[] args: The method accepts a single argument, an array of String objects. This can be used to pass command-line arguments to the program.

7. Print Statement: System.out.println("Hello, World!"); prints the string "Hello, World!" to the console.

8. System.out is a standard output stream.

9. println is a method that prints the argument passed to it and then terminates the line.

This simple program demonstrates the basic structure of a Java application. You can expand it by adding more methods and functionality as needed.
