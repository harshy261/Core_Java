Ternary Operator in Java:


The ternary operator is a shorthand way of writing an if-else statement. It is also known as the conditional operator. It takes three operands and is used to evaluate a boolean expression. 

The syntax is:
condition ? expression1 : expression2;

condition: The boolean expression to evaluate.
expression1: The value to return if the condition is true.
expression2: The value to return if the condition is false.
