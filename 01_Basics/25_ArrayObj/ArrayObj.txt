In Java, you can create arrays that hold objects. This is useful when you need to manage a collection of objects of the same type. An array of objects allows you to store multiple instances of a class in a single array, making it easier to manage and manipulate the data.

Key Concepts:

Class Definition:
A class defines the blueprint for objects. It contains fields (variables) and methods (functions) that define the behavior of the objects.

Creating Objects:
Objects are instances of a class. They are created using the new keyword followed by the class constructor.

Array of Objects:
An array of objects is an array that holds references to objects. Each element in the array is a reference to an instance of the class.

Relevant Interview Questions and Answers:

Q: What is an array of objects in Java?
A: An array of objects in Java is an array that holds references to instances of a class. It allows you to store multiple objects of the same type in a single array.
Q: How do you declare and initialize an array of objects in Java?
A: An array of objects can be declared and initialized as follows:
Student[] students = new Student[3]; // Declaration
students[0] = new Student(); // Initialization
students[1] = new Student();
students[2] = new Student();

Q: How do you access elements in an array of objects?
A: Elements in an array of objects are accessed using their index. For example, students[0] accesses the first element of the array.
Q: Can you store different types of objects in a single array?
A: No, an array can only store objects of the same type. If you need to store different types of objects, you can use an array of type Object, but this is generally not recommended due to type safety concerns.
Q: How do you iterate over an array of objects in Java?
A: You can iterate over an array of objects using a traditional for loop or an enhanced for loop. For example:
for (int i = 0; i < students.length; i++) {
    System.out.println(students[i].name);
}
// or
for (Student student : students) {
    System.out.println(student.name);
}

Q: What are the advantages of using arrays of objects?
A: Arrays of objects allow you to manage collections of objects more efficiently. They provide a way to store and access multiple instances of a class using a single variable, making the code more organized and easier to maintain.
