*******************************************************************************************************

In Java, a constructor is a special method that is called when an object is instantiated (created). Constructors are used to initialize the object's state (i.e., its fields or properties). They have the same name as the class and do not have a return type.

Default Constructor:
A default constructor is a constructor that takes no arguments. If no constructor is explicitly defined in a class, the Java compiler automatically provides a default constructor.

Parameterized Constructor:
A parameterized constructor is a constructor that takes one or more arguments. It allows you to initialize an object with specific values when it is created.

Constructor Overloading:
Constructor overloading is the practice of defining multiple constructors in a class, each with a different parameter list. This allows you to create objects in different ways.

Relevant Interview Questions and Answers:

Q: What is a constructor in Java?
A: A constructor in Java is a special method that is called when an object is instantiated. It is used to initialize the object's state (i.e., its fields or properties). Constructors have the same name as the class and do not have a return type.


Q: What is a default constructor?
A: A default constructor is a constructor that takes no arguments. If no constructor is explicitly defined in a class, the Java compiler automatically provides a default constructor.


Q: What is a parameterized constructor?
A: A parameterized constructor is a constructor that takes one or more arguments. It allows you to initialize an object with specific values when it is created.


Q: Can a class have multiple constructors?
A: Yes, a class can have multiple constructors with different parameter lists. This is known as constructor overloading. It allows you to create objects in different ways.


Q: What is the purpose of the this keyword in constructors?
A: The this keyword in constructors is used to refer to the current object. It is often used to distinguish between instance variables and parameters with the same name.


Q: Can constructors be inherited in Java?
A: No, constructors are not inherited in Java. Each class must define its own constructors. However, a subclass can call a superclass constructor using the super keyword.
