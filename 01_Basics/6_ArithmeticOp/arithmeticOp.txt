Arithmetic Operators in Java:


Addition (+): Adds two operands.

Subtraction (-): Subtracts the second operand from the first.

Multiplication (*): Multiplies two operands.

Division (/): Divides the first operand by the second. If both operands are integers, the result is an integer (fractional part is discarded).

Modulus (%): Returns the remainder of the division of the first operand by the second.
