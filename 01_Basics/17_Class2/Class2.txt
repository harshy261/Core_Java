Assumptions:
There is a Calculator class with an add method that takes two integers as parameters and returns their sum.
The main method is part of a class, likely named Class2.

Explanation:
Class Declaration:

public class Class2 { ... }: This defines a public class named Class2. This class contains the main method, which is the entry point of the Java application.
Main Method:

public static void main(String[] args) { ... }: This is the main method, which is the entry point of any Java application. When you run the program, the code inside this method is executed.
Variable Declaration:

int num2 = 5;: Declares an integer variable named num2 and initializes it to 5.
Creating an Object:

Calculator calc = new Calculator();: This line creates an object calc of the Calculator class using the new keyword and the class constructor Calculator(). This allocates memory for the new object and initializes it.

Calling the add Method:

int result = calc.add(4, 5);: Calls the add method of the Calculator class on the calc object, passing 4 and 5 as arguments. The add method returns the sum of these two numbers, which is 9, and assigns it to the variable result.
Commented Out Code:

// calc.add();: This line is commented out. If uncommented, it would attempt to call an add method with no arguments, which is not defined in the provided context.
// int result = calc.add();: This line is commented out. If uncommented, it would attempt to call an add method with no arguments and assign the result to result, which is not defined in the provided context.
// int result = num1 + num2;: This line is commented out. If uncommented, it would attempt to add num1 and num2 and assign the result to result. However, num1 is not defined in the provided context.

Printing the Result:

System.out.println(result);: Prints the value of result to the console. Since result is 9, the output will be:
