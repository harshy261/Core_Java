Concept of Packages in Java:
In Java, a package is a way to organize and group related classes, interfaces, and sub-packages. Think of a package as a folder in a file system that contains related files. Packages help to avoid name conflicts, manage access control, and make it easier to locate and use classes.

Key Concepts:
Organization:

Packages help to organize your code into logical groups. For example, you might have a package for user-related classes, another for database-related classes, and so on.
Avoiding Name Conflicts:

By grouping classes into packages, you can avoid name conflicts. For example, you can have two classes with the same name in different packages.
Access Control:

Packages help to control access to classes and methods. You can specify which classes and methods are accessible from outside the package.
Using Packages:

To use a class from a package, you need to import the package. This is similar to including a library in other programming languages.



Relevant Interview Questions and Answers:
Q: What is a package in Java?

A: A package in Java is a way to organize and group related classes, interfaces, and sub-packages. It helps to avoid name conflicts, manage access control, and make it easier to locate and use classes.
Q: How do you declare a package in Java?

A: You declare a package at the top of a Java file using the package keyword followed by the package name. For example:

package com.example.myapp;



Q: How do you import a class from a package in Java?

A: You import a class from a package using the import keyword followed by the package name and class name. For example:
import java.util.ArrayList;


Q: What is the purpose of the import statement in Java?

A: The import statement allows you to use classes from other packages without having to specify their full package name each time. It makes the code more readable and easier to manage.
Q: Can you have two classes with the same name in different packages?

A: Yes, you can have two classes with the same name in different packages. The package name ensures that the classes are uniquely identified.
Q: What is the difference between import package.* and import package.ClassName?

A: import package.* imports all classes from the specified package, while import package.ClassName imports only the specified class from the package. Using import package.* can lead to namespace pollution, so it's generally better to import only the classes you need.
