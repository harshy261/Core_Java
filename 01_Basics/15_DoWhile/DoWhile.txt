Do-While Loop in Java:

The do-while loop is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a given boolean condition. Unlike the while loop, the do-while loop guarantees that the loop body is executed at least once before the condition is tested.

do 
{
    // code to be executed
} 
while (condition);

do: The block of code inside the do is executed once before the condition is tested.

condition: This expression is evaluated after each iteration. If it evaluates to true, the loop body is executed again. If it evaluates to false, the loop terminates.
