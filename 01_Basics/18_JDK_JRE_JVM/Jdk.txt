Concepts of JDK, JRE, and JVM:
JDK (Java Development Kit):

What it is: The JDK is a software development kit used to develop Java applications.
What's included: It includes the JRE (Java Runtime Environment) and development tools like compilers and debuggers.
Analogy: Think of the JDK as a toolbox for building Java applications. It has all the tools you need to write, compile, and debug your code.
JRE (Java Runtime Environment):

What it is: The JRE is a set of software tools that provide the environment in which Java applications run.
What's included: It includes the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) and library classes that Java applications need to run.
Analogy: Think of the JRE as a theater where a play (Java application) is performed. It provides the stage and the necessary props (library classes) for the play to run.

JVM (Java Virtual Machine):

What it is: The JVM is a virtual machine that interprets and executes Java bytecode.
What's included: It includes the interpreter that converts bytecode into machine code that the computer's processor can execute.
Analogy: Think of the JVM as a translator who translates a script (Java bytecode) into actions that actors (the computer's processor) can perform.
