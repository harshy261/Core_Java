*******************************************************************************************************

A three-dimensional (3D) array in Java is an array of arrays of arrays. It allows you to store data in a three-dimensional structure, which can be visualized as a cube or a collection of tables.

Key Concepts:

Declaration:
3D arrays are declared by specifying the type of elements they will hold, followed by three sets of square brackets [][][].

Initialization:
3D arrays can be initialized at the time of declaration or later using the new keyword.

Accessing Elements:
Elements in a 3D array are accessed using three indices: one for the depth, one for the row, and one for the column.

Length:
The length of each dimension can be accessed using the length property.

Relevant Interview Questions and Answers:
Q: What is a three-dimensional array in Java?

A: A three-dimensional array in Java is an array of arrays of arrays. It allows you to store data in a three-dimensional structure, which can be visualized as a cube or a collection of tables.
Q: How do you declare a three-dimensional array in Java?

A: A three-dimensional array can be declared as follows:
int[][][] nums = new int[3][4][5]; // 3x4x5 array

Q: How do you initialize a three-dimensional array in Java?

A: A three-dimensional array can be initialized at the time of declaration or later using the new keyword. For example:
int[][][] nums = new int[3][4][5];

Q: How do you access elements in a three-dimensional array?

A: Elements in a three-dimensional array are accessed using three indices: one for the depth, one for the row, and one for the column. For example, nums[0][1][2] accesses the element at depth 0, row 1, and column 2.
Q: What is the difference between a two-dimensional and a three-dimensional array?

A: A two-dimensional array stores data in a table-like structure with rows and columns, while a three-dimensional array stores data in a cube-like structure with depth, rows, and columns.
Q: How do you iterate over a three-dimensional array in Java?

A: You can iterate over a three-dimensional array using nested for loops. For example:
for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < nums[i].length; j++) {
        for (int k = 0; k < nums[i][j].length; k++) {
            System.out.print(nums[i][j][k] + " ");
        }
        System.out.println();
    }
    System.out.println();
}
