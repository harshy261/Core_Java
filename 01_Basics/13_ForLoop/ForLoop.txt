For Loop in Java:


The for loop is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a given boolean condition. It is typically used when the number of iterations is known before entering the loop.

for (initialization; condition; update) 
{
    // code to be executed
}

initialization: This step is executed once before the loop starts. It is typically used to initialize a loop control variable.

condition: This expression is evaluated before each iteration. If it evaluates to true, the loop body is executed. If it evaluates to false, the loop terminates.

update: This step is executed after each iteration of the loop. It is typically used to update the loop control variable.
