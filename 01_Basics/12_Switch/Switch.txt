Switch Statement in Java:

The switch statement is a control flow statement that allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values. Each value is called a case, and the variable being switched on is checked for each case.

switch (variable): The variable to be compared against the case values.
case value: A value to compare against the variable.
break: Exits the switch statement. If omitted, execution will continue to the next case.
default: Optional. Executes if no case matches the variable.
